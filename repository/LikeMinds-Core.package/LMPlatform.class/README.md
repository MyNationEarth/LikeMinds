LMPlatform

LMPlatform answers questions that are platform specific. Currently the only supported platform is GemStone/S running under unix. However it's expected that in the future, perhaps Pharo would also be a platform where a limited LikeMinds instance may reside.

It's not expected that LikeMinds will ever be deployed under Windows since it's simply not suitable for enterprise applications. Regardless, we'll attempt where possible to support Windows in case anyone chooses to help develop LikeMinds under Windows.
